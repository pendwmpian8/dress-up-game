Welcome to my **Mini Bunny Dress-Up Game** â€” a playful little web experiment where you can change the background, dress, and shoes of a bunny character by clicking buttons!

##  About This Project

This project was created as a **personal front-end experiment**. The goal wasn't to build something perfect or production-ready, but rather to:

- Get more comfortable with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Understand how images can be layered and dynamically changed
- Explore interactive UI design in a lightweight, browser-based way
- Have fun building something cute and creative!

---

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by **Nashallery** on TikTok, whose super adorable and creative dress-up game inspired me to try and create my own!~

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- The bunny character is composed of layered transparent PNGs: a base image, background, outfit, and shoes.
- Clicking the buttons cycles through different images for each category.
- Images are swapped using JavaScript and `querySelector`.
- Everything is styled with simple CSS and a pixel-style Google font.

---

##  Features

- Click buttons to cycle through:
  -  Backgrounds
  -  Dresses
  -  Shoes
- Uses `Pixelify Sans` from Google Fonts for a fun retro look
- Lightweight and runs in the browser with no frameworks

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Make sure all image files are in the correct `assets/images/` folder
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
4. Click buttons to dress up the bunny!
